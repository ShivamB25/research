# 10Clouds LLM Fine-Tuning Service Analysis

## What It Is
10Clouds isn't a platform, but rather a tech consultancy and software development company that *offers* custom LLM fine-tuning as a service. They seem to specialize in taking open-source models, especially from the Llama family, and adapting them for specific business needs.

## Service Model
*   **Done-For-You Service**: They handle the entire fine-tuning project for you, from start to finish. It's not a self-serve tool or platform.
*   **Focus**: Primarily tailoring open-source LLMs (like Llama) to improve accuracy and performance for specific industries or tasks.

## What Their Service Includes
*   **Consulting**: Helping choose the right base model (e.g., Llama 7B, 13B, 70B) and designing any necessary architectural tweaks.
*   **Data Prep**: Handling data cleaning, preprocessing, augmentation, and even generating synthetic data if needed.
*   **Fine-Tuning Work**: Actually performing the fine-tuning using various techniques (they mention LoRA, QLoRA, P-Tuning v2, instruction tuning, RAG) and optimizing the process.
*   **Evaluation**: Thoroughly testing the resulting model using standard metrics (Perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU) and custom tests relevant to the client's task.
*   **Deployment Help**: Assisting clients in getting the fine-tuned model running within their systems and optimizing it for speed.
*   **Ongoing Support**: Offering continued maintenance, updates, technical help, and team training.
*   **Tech Stack**: They use a range of common AI/ML tools and frameworks (PyTorch, Hugging Face, DeepSpeed, PEFT, Ray, MLflow, W&B, ONNX, TensorRT, Triton, Spark NLP, etc.).

## Example Use Cases They Mention
*   Smarter customer service chatbots.
*   Analyzing legal contracts.
*   Processing financial documents.
*   Handling medical reports.
*   Generating specific types of content.
*   Understanding industry-specific jargon.

## Pricing
*   **How it works**: It's **custom, project-based pricing**.
*   **Details**: You won't find a standard price list (per token, per hour, etc.) on their site. The cost depends entirely on the scope, complexity, length, and resources needed for your specific project.
*   **Getting a Quote**: You need to contact them directly for a consultation to discuss your needs and get a personalized proposal.

## Who It's For
*   Businesses that want experts to handle the entire custom LLM fine-tuning process.
*   Organizations preferring a service/consultancy model instead of managing a platform internally.
*   Companies specifically interested in fine-tuning Llama or other open-source models for their applications.
