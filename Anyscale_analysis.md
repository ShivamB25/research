# Anyscale Fine-Tuning Analysis

## What It Is
Anyscale offers a platform based on the open-source Ray framework, designed to help scale AI and Python applications. For LLMs, they provide fine-tuning capabilities, mainly through their **Anyscale Endpoints** service (which is now part of the main Anyscale Platform). The focus is on optimizing open-source models.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
*   **Managed Service**: Fine-tuning is offered as a service via Anyscale Endpoints, simplifying the process.
*   **Open-Source Focus**: Primarily designed for fine-tuning popular open-source LLMs (like Llama 2 and Mistral).
*   **Built on Ray**: Leverages the Ray framework for efficient and scalable training and model serving.
*   **Deployment**: Fine-tuned models can be easily deployed as dedicated endpoints through the service.
*   **Private Deployment Option**: Offers "Private Endpoints" which allow deploying models within your own cloud environment for better security and control (pricing for this is likely custom).
*   **LLMForge Library**: Anyscale provides this specific library to help with scalable fine-tuning on their platform.
*   **Technique Support**: Their documentation mentions support for various fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and full-parameter tuning.

## Pricing (Anyscale Endpoints Fine-tuning)
*   **How it works**: Based on a blog post from October 2023, pricing is token-based with a small fixed fee to start each job.
*   **Costs (as of Oct 2023)**:
    *   **Job Start Fee**: $5 per fine-tuning job.
    *   **Fine-tuning Cost (per 1 Million Tokens Processed)**:
        *   Small models (e.g., Llama 2 7B): $1.00
        *   Medium models (e.g., Llama 2 13B): $2.00
    *   **Serving Cost (After Tuning, per 1 Million Tokens In/Out)**:
        *   Small models (e.g., Llama 2 7B): $0.25
        *   Medium models (e.g., Llama 2 13B): $0.50
*   **Important Note**: This pricing is from late 2023. Since the service is now part of the main platform, it's best to check with Anyscale directly for the most current rates, especially for larger models or the Private Endpoints option.

## Who It's For
*   Organizations wanting a managed service specifically for fine-tuning popular open-source LLMs.
*   Users already familiar with or interested in using the Ray ecosystem for scaling AI work.
*   Teams looking for cost-effective ways to fine-tune and serve OSS models.
*   Companies that need the option to deploy securely within their own cloud (via Private Endpoints).
