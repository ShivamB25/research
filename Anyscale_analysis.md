# Anyscale Fine-Tuning Analysis

## Overview
Anyscale provides a platform built on the open-source Ray framework for scaling AI and Python workloads. They offer LLM fine-tuning capabilities, primarily through their **Anyscale Endpoints** service (now integrated into the main Anyscale Platform), which focuses on optimizing open-source models.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
- **Managed Service**: Offers fine-tuning as a service via Anyscale Endpoints.
- **Focus on OSS**: Primarily targets fine-tuning popular open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral mentioned).
- **Performance & Cost Optimized**: Leverages the Ray framework for efficient, scalable training and serving.
- **Deployment**: Fine-tuned models can be deployed as dedicated endpoints.
- **Private Endpoints Option**: Allows deploying endpoints within the customer's own cloud environment for enhanced security and control (likely custom pricing).
- **LLMForge Library**: A specific library mentioned for scalable fine-tuning on the Anyscale platform.
- **Supported Techniques**: The main use-case page mentions support for various techniques like LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning.

## Pricing (Anyscale Endpoints Fine-tuning)
- **Model**: Token-based pricing plus a fixed job start cost (as per Oct 2023 blog post).
- **Costs**:
    - **Fixed Job Start Cost**: $5 per fine-tuning job.
    - **Fine-tuning Cost (per 1 Million Tokens Processed)**:
        - Small models (e.g., Llama 2 7B): $1.00
        - Medium models (e.g., Llama 2 13B): $2.00
    - **Serving Cost (Post-Tuning, per 1 Million Tokens In/Out)**:
        - Small models (e.g., Llama 2 7B): $0.25
        - Medium models (e.g., Llama 2 13B): $0.50
- **Note**: This pricing was announced in Oct 2023. While the service is now part of the main platform, it's advisable to confirm current pricing directly with Anyscale. Pricing for larger models or Private Endpoints may differ.

## Target Audience
- Organizations looking for a managed service to fine-tune popular open-source LLMs.
- Users familiar with or interested in leveraging the Ray ecosystem for scalable AI.
- Teams prioritizing cost-effective fine-tuning and serving of OSS models.
- Companies needing options for secure deployment within their own cloud (Private Endpoints).
