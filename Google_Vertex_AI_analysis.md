# Google Vertex AI Fine-Tuning Analysis

## What It Is
Google Vertex AI is Google Cloud's all-in-one platform for machine learning. It covers the whole process from building to deploying and managing models, including options for fine-tuning LLMs and other generative AI models like Imagen (for images).

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
*   **Integrated Platform**: It's part of the main Vertex AI MLOps setup on Google Cloud.
*   **Google Model Support**: You can fine-tune Google's own models, specifically the Gemini family (1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, 2.0 Flash Lite) and the Imagen image generation models. Pricing is clearly laid out for these.
*   **Partner Models**: Vertex AI also lets you use models from partners like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and AI21 Labs. However, whether you can fine-tune these directly on Vertex AI, and how much that would cost, isn't specified on the main pricing page and might need checking.
*   **Tuning Methods**: The pricing page doesn't list specific techniques, but Vertex AI generally supports standard methods like supervised fine-tuning. The exact options might depend on the model.
*   **Prediction Costs**: After you fine-tune a model, using it for predictions costs the same as using the original base model.
*   **Cost Savers**: Includes features like Context Caching (to reuse input tokens) and Provisioned Throughput (to reserve capacity at a fixed rate).

## Pricing (Fine-Tuning Google's Models)
*   **How it works**: You're charged based on the number of training tokens processed during the fine-tuning job (specifically, per 1 million tokens).
*   **Cost per 1 Million Training Tokens**:
    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro: $80.00
    *   Gemini 1.5 Flash: $8.00
    *   Gemini 2.0 Flash: $3.00
    *   Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite: $1.00
*   **Imagen 2 Tuning**: This is different; it's charged per node hour using standard Vertex AI custom training rates, not per token.
*   **Prediction Costs (After Tuning)**: These are the same as the base model and can get complicated. They depend on the model used (Pro vs. Flash), the type of data (text, image, audio, video), whether it's input or output, and the context window size (costs increase for very large contexts).
*   **Other Costs**: Don't forget standard Google Cloud charges for things like data storage (Cloud Storage) and networking.

## Who It's For
*   Organizations already using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
*   Teams specifically wanting to fine-tune Google's Gemini or Imagen models.
*   Users looking for a single, integrated platform on GCP to manage the ML lifecycle.
