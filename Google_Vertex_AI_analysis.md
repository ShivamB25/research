# Google Vertex AI Fine-Tuning Analysis

## Overview
Google Vertex AI is a unified machine learning platform on Google Cloud that offers capabilities for building, deploying, and managing ML models, including fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and other generative models.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
- **Integrated Platform**: Part of the broader Vertex AI MLOps platform on Google Cloud.
- **Supported Google Models**: Fine-tuning is explicitly priced for Google's Gemini family (1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, 2.0 Flash Lite) and Imagen (image models).
- **Partner Models**: Vertex AI also hosts models from partners (Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, AI21 Labs), though fine-tuning capabilities/pricing for these might differ or require separate investigation.
- **Tuning Methods**: While not detailed on the pricing page, Vertex AI typically supports methods like supervised fine-tuning. Specific methods might vary by model.
- **Prediction**: Tuned model endpoints use the same prediction pricing structure as the base model.
- **Context Caching**: Feature to potentially reduce costs for requests with repeated context.
- **Provisioned Throughput**: Option to reserve capacity for guaranteed throughput.

## Pricing (Fine-Tuning Google Models)
- **Model**: Charged per 1 million training tokens processed during fine-tuning.
- **Costs per 1 Million Training Tokens**:
    - Gemini 1.5 Pro: $80.00
    - Gemini 1.5 Flash: $8.00
    - Gemini 2.0 Flash: $3.00
    - Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite: $1.00
- **Imagen 2 (Image Model) Tuning**: Charged per node hour based on standard Vertex AI custom training pricing (not per token).
- **Prediction Costs (Post-Tuning)**: Same as the base model. Prices vary significantly based on:
    - Model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro vs. 1.5 Flash)
    - Modality (text characters, images, audio/video seconds)
    - Input vs. Output
    - Context window size (higher prices for >128K or >200K tokens depending on model)
- **Other Costs**: Standard Google Cloud costs for storage, networking, etc., may apply.

## Target Audience
- Organizations using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Users wanting to fine-tune Google's Gemini or Imagen models on their own data.
- Teams looking for an integrated MLOps platform for managing the entire model lifecycle.
