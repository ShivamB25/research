# Snorkel AI Fine-Tuning Analysis

## Overview
Snorkel AI provides a data-centric AI development platform, **Snorkel Flow**, focused on programmatic data labeling and weak supervision. Fine-tuning LLMs is a key capability within this platform, emphasizing the creation of high-quality training data to build smaller, specialized, and accurate models for enterprise use cases.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
- **Data-Centric Workflow**: Strong focus on curating high-quality training data using programmatic labeling (labeling functions), SME collaboration, synthetic data generation, and error analysis *before* fine-tuning.
- **Snorkel Flow Platform**: Provides a unified environment for data labeling, iteration, evaluation, and orchestrating fine-tuning.
- **Integration with Compute Platforms**: Snorkel Flow integrates with major cloud ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure Machine Learning, Databricks Mosaic AI) to execute the actual fine-tuning jobs. Snorkel manages the data preparation and orchestration.
- **Alignment Capabilities**: Tools and workflows designed to align models with domain-specific knowledge, human preferences, policies, and ethical standards.
- **Evaluation**: Includes built-in LLM evaluation features.
- **Supported Models**: Can be used to prepare data for fine-tuning various foundation models (logos shown for Meta, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Mistral, Cohere, Together AI).

## Pricing
- **Model**: Pricing is not publicly listed on the fine-tuning page. It is likely **custom enterprise pricing** based on a license for the Snorkel Flow platform.
- **Compute Costs**: In addition to the Snorkel Flow license, users will incur separate compute costs on the chosen cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks) where the fine-tuning job is executed via the integration.
- **Professional Services**: Snorkel also offers "Snorkel Custom" services for expert assistance.

## Target Audience
- Enterprises focused on building highly accurate, specialized models where data quality and labeling are critical bottlenecks.
- Organizations looking for a programmatic and iterative approach to data preparation for fine-tuning.
- Teams that want to leverage SME knowledge effectively in the fine-tuning process.
- Companies already using or planning to use major cloud ML platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks) for compute.
