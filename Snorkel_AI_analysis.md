# Snorkel AI Fine-Tuning Analysis

## What It Is
Snorkel AI offers a platform called **Snorkel Flow**, which takes a different approach to AI development. Its main strength lies in preparing high-quality training data, especially using programmatic labeling (where you write functions to label data) and weak supervision techniques. Fine-tuning LLMs is part of the platform, but the emphasis is heavily on getting the data right *first* to build smaller, more accurate, specialized models for businesses.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
*   **Data-First Workflow**: The core idea is to spend more effort curating excellent training data. Snorkel Flow provides tools for programmatic labeling, involving subject matter experts (SMEs), generating synthetic data, and analyzing errors *before* you even start fine-tuning.
*   **Snorkel Flow Platform**: This is the central hub for labeling data, iterating on it, evaluating models, and kicking off the fine-tuning process.
*   **Works with Other Clouds**: Interestingly, Snorkel Flow doesn't do the heavy compute for fine-tuning itself. Instead, it integrates with the major cloud ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure Machine Learning, Databricks Mosaic AI). Snorkel handles the data prep and tells the other platform to run the job.
*   **Focus on Alignment**: Includes tools and workflows specifically designed to make sure the fine-tuned models align with your company's specific knowledge, expert preferences, internal policies, and ethical guidelines.
*   **Evaluation Built-In**: Comes with features for evaluating how well the LLMs are performing.
*   **Model Compatibility**: You can use Snorkel Flow to prepare data for fine-tuning a variety of foundation models (their site shows logos for models from Meta, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Cohere, and Together AI).

## Pricing
*   **How it works**: Snorkel doesn't list standard prices on their site. It's almost certainly **custom enterprise pricing**, likely involving a license fee for the Snorkel Flow platform itself.
*   **Compute Costs are Separate**: Remember, since Snorkel Flow uses other platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks) to actually run the fine-tuning, you'll also have to pay those platforms directly for the compute time used during the job.
*   **Services Option**: They also offer "Snorkel Custom," which sounds like professional services if you need extra help.

## Who It's For
*   Companies where getting high-quality labeled data is the main challenge for building accurate, specialized models.
*   Organizations interested in a programmatic, code-based approach to data labeling and preparation for fine-tuning.
*   Teams that want to deeply involve their subject matter experts in the AI development process.
*   Businesses already using one of the major cloud ML platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks) and looking for a better data preparation layer.
