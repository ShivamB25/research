# Together AI Fine-Tuning Analysis

## What It Is
Together AI runs a cloud platform they call the "AI Acceleration Cloud." It's built to provide fast and reasonably priced infrastructure for running and fine-tuning large AI models, with a strong emphasis on open-source options.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
*   **Managed Service**: Offers fine-tuning as a straightforward service on their platform.
*   **Open-Source Friendly**: Supports a broad selection of popular open-source models (like the Llama family, Qwen, Mixtral, Mistral, CodeLlama).
*   **Performance Focus**: The platform is geared for speed, running on modern NVIDIA GPUs.
*   **You Own the Model**: Lets you download the checkpoints and final weights of your fine-tuned model.
*   **Tracking**: You can monitor job status and view logs through their command-line tool or web UI (Playgrounds).
*   **Easy Deployment**: Fine-tuned models can be deployed quickly, typically onto their Dedicated Endpoint infrastructure for serving.

## Pricing (Fine-Tuning)
*   **How it works**: It's usage-based. The cost depends on the base model you choose, the amount of training data (in tokens), the amount of validation data (tokens), how many times you run through the data (epochs), and how many evaluations you perform.
*   **Cost Calculation**: The basic idea is: Total Cost â‰ˆ (Tokens Processed in Training * Rate) + (Tokens Processed in Validation * Rate) + Minimum Fee. The specific *Rate* (cost per token processed) varies depending on which base model you're tuning.
*   **Minimum Charge**: There's a $5 minimum cost for any fine-tuning job.
*   **Cost Estimator**: Their pricing page has an interactive calculator to help estimate costs.
*   **Rough Cost Example (from calculator)**: Tuning Llama 3.1 (8B) with 10M training tokens, 1M validation tokens, 3 epochs, and 10 evaluations comes out to around $366.
*   **Serving Costs (After Tuning)**: You can deploy your fine-tuned model on:
    *   **Dedicated Endpoints**: These are billed per minute based on the GPU hardware you choose (e.g., L40S, A100 80GB, H100 80GB, H200 141GB). On-demand rates seem to range from about $1.49/hour to $4.99/hour.
    *   (Using their Serverless Endpoints for custom models isn't explicitly mentioned but might be possible).
*   **GPU Clusters**: For very large jobs, you can also rent dedicated GPU clusters (A100, H100, H200, etc.) with hourly pricing.

## Who It's For
*   Developers and companies wanting a fast, relatively affordable platform for fine-tuning and serving open-source LLMs.
*   Users who value the ability to download and own their fine-tuned model weights.
*   Teams that prioritize high performance and access to the latest GPU hardware.
