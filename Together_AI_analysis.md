# Together AI Fine-Tuning Analysis

## Overview
Together AI provides a cloud platform ("AI Acceleration Cloud") focused on providing fast and cost-effective infrastructure for running and fine-tuning large AI models, particularly open-source ones.

## Key Features for Fine-Tuning
- **Managed Service**: Offers fine-tuning as a service on their platform.
- **Focus on OSS**: Supports a wide range of popular open-source models (Llama family, Qwen, Mixtral, Mistral, CodeLlama, etc.).
- **Performance**: Platform is optimized for speed on modern hardware (NVIDIA GPUs).
- **Model Ownership**: Allows downloading checkpoints and final model weights.
- **Monitoring**: Provides job status and logs via CLI or UI (Playgrounds).
- **Deployment**: Fine-tuned models can be instantly deployed, likely on their Dedicated Endpoint infrastructure.

## Pricing (Fine-Tuning)
- **Model**: Usage-based, calculated based on the base model selected, the size of the training dataset (tokens), the size of the validation dataset (tokens), the number of training epochs, and the number of evaluations performed.
- **Cost Calculation**: Total cost = (Training Tokens * Epochs * Rate) + (Validation Tokens * Epochs * Evaluations * Rate) + Base Fee (if applicable). The specific *Rate* ($ per processed token) depends on the base model being fine-tuned.
- **Minimum Job Cost**: $5.00 per fine-tuning job.
- **Interactive Calculator**: Available on the pricing page to estimate costs based on parameters.
- **Example Cost (from calculator)**: Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 (8B) with 10M training tokens, 1M validation tokens, 3 epochs, and 10 evaluations is estimated at $366.00.
- **Inference Costs (Post-Tuning)**: Fine-tuned models can be deployed on:
    - **Dedicated Endpoints**: Billed per minute based on GPU instance type (e.g., L40S, A100 80GB, H100 80GB, H200 141GB). Rates range from ~$1.49/hr to ~$4.99/hr (On-Demand).
    - (Serverless endpoint support for custom models not explicitly stated but possible).
- **GPU Clusters**: Dedicated clusters with hourly pricing are also available for large-scale training or inference needs.

## Target Audience
- Developers and organizations looking for a fast, cost-effective platform to fine-tune and serve open-source LLMs.
- Users who want the flexibility to download their fine-tuned model weights.
- Teams prioritizing performance and access to modern GPU infrastructure (A100, H100, H200, etc.).
